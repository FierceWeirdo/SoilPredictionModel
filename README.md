# Bare Ground Prediction Model with Random Forest and Recursive Feature Elimination

## Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the percentage of bare ground over a certain set of land based on terrain files. The model uses the Random Forest algorithm, known for its robustness and versatility in handling regression tasks. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is employed for feature selection to enhance the model's performance.
